Unfortunately, the original [link to the DBbook dataset](http://challenges.2014.eswc-conferences.org/index.php/RecSys) is no working anymore. Using tools like [waybackmachines](https://web.archive.org/web/20180402195813/http://challenges.2014.eswc-conferences.org/index.php/RecSys), it possible to access that page and download some files, but only the training data is available in the backups that have been made, while test data is not obtaibale.
For these reasons, we considered the version of the dataset that have been used in other works listed below and reachable at the [public repository](https://github.com/swapUniba/Deep_CBRS_Amar/tree/master/datasets/dbbook) of our SWAP Research Group: 
- https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3523227.3551484
- https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3565472.3592965
- https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3627043.3659548
- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-024-09417-x


To the best of our knowledge, the DBbook dataset cannot be fully downloaded out of our repository, and we believe that bringing back this dataset (enhanced with multimodal features) can contribute to the RecSys community.
